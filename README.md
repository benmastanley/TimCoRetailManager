<h3>Situation Setup</h3>
In this simulation, we work for TimCo Enterprise solutions. We build solutions that we can then sell to clients. Right now, we have been assigned to build a retail management system. Over time, we will get new requirements, or new work entirely, just like in a real job.
<h3>Initial Project</h3>
We need to build a desktop app that runs a cash register, handles inventory, and manages the entire store. In order to allow it to grow, though, we will be creating a WebAPI layer.
<h3>Initial Plan</h3>
I want to build a MVP that we can expand to cover all of the features we need over time. The first step is getting all of the major pieces set up, including: 
<ul>
 <li>Git on Azure DevOps</li>
 <li>SQL database (SSDT)</li>
 <li>WebAPI with authentication</li>
 <li>WPF application that can log into the API</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upcoming Technologies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unit Testing</li>
<li>Dependency Injection</li> 
<li>WPF</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC</li>
<li>.NET Core (Translation from Framework to Core)</li> 
<li>SSDT</li> 
<li>Git</li>
<li>Azure DevOps</li>
<li>Design Patterns</li> 
<li>Async</li> 
<li>Reporting</li> 
<li>WebAPI</li> 
<li>Logging</li> 
<li>Data Validation</li> 
<li>HTML</li> 
<li>CSS</li> 
<li>JavaScript</li> 
<li>Authentication</li>
</ul>
